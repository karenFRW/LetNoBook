# LetNoBook
Let No Book 電子聯絡簿系統 APP 開發

This is a side project I created with my team. There are 5 people in my team, 3 build a website, me and another team member developed this Android app.

Why we made this project? 

In Taiwan, due to elementary school is too rely on the communication book to exchange kids' learning situation and teacher shares opinions to parents or parents have some special point need to ask teacher take care of their kid more. What if kid forgot to bring the communication book to school, or bring it back home? Then kids might won't remember what's homework or homework's time frame, or teacher leaves something important message to parents, they won't know. So we have this idea, they can use website, mobile app to do their communication. No need to limited by time, kid, even location. 

Anytime, anywhere, you can do the communication with kid, parents, teacher, if you have internet.
